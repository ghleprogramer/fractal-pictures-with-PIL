project_fractal_image_with_PIL is the main file for creating the images.

pf is the second file contaning the fractal set creation functions,
and the function for creating lists of a given length for a given range,
and a function to adjust the x range so that the ratio between the range of x and y is the same as the image ratio.

X range values mandelbrot (-2, 0.5)(-0.81, -0.71) (-0.75, -0.7371338)
Y range values mandelbrot (-1.15, 1.15)(-.19, -.08) (0.13, 0.1328046)
X range values burning ship (-2.5, 1) (-1.8, -1.7) (-1.65, -1.6) (-1.6, -1.55) (-1.6107, -1.5807) (0.5, 1.24)
Y range values burning ship (-2, 1) (-.085, .01) (-0.07, 0.007) (-0.04, 0.004) (-.02, .001) (-1.56, -1.5)
